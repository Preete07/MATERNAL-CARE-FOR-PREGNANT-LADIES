OBJECTIVES:
•	To enable the continuous monitoring of health parameters  in maternity care.

•	To make SOS calls to the nearby hospitals and to a homie in the  emergency situation.
•	To schedule the tablets intake timings

OUTCOMES:
*	Improved Monitoring: The wristband may allow pregnant women to monitor vital signs like heart rate, fetal movement, and contractions, leading to better awareness of their health and the baby's well-being. 
*	Enhanced Convenience: If the project succeeds, pregnant women may experience increased comfort and convenience in tracking their pregnancy-related data 
*	Cost Savings: If the wearable reduces the need for hospital visits or interventions, it could lead to cost savings for both patients and healthcare provider
